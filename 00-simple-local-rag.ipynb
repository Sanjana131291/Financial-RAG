The we can create this with the [`transformers.BitsAndBytesConfig`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.38.2/en/main_classes/quantization#transformers.BitsAndBytesConfig) class (requires installing the [`bitsandbytes` library](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes)).\n",

        "3. A tokenzier - This is what will turn our raw text into tokens ready for the model. We can create it using the [`transformers.AutoTokenzier.from_pretrained`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.38.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer) method and passing it our model ID.\n",
        "4. An LLM model - Again, using our model ID we can load a specific LLM model. To do so we can use the [`transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained) method and passing it our model ID as well as other various parameters.\n",

Flash Attention 2 speeds up the attention mechanism in Transformer architecture models (which is what many modern LLMs are based on, including Gemma). So if it's available and the model is supported (not all models support Flash Attention 2), we'll use it. If it's not available, you can install it by following the instructions on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention).\n",

You will then have to authorize your local machine via the [Hugging Face CLI/Hugging Face Hub `login()` function](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/quick-start#authentication). Once you've done this, you'll be able to download the models.

        "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",
        "\\nExample 2:\n",
        "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
        "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
        "\\nExample 3:\n",
        "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
        "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",
